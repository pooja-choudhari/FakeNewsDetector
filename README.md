# FakeNewsDetector
Description
* This dataset consists of about 40000 articles consisting of fake as well as real news. The objective of this project is to correctly predict whether a   given piece of news is real or fake.The fake and real news data is given in two separate datasets with each dataset consisting around 20000 articles each.

Approach
 * Performed Exploratory Data Analysis and text data cleaning to remove punctuations and stopwords. 
 * Perform tokenizing and padding on text corpus to feed the deep learning model.
 * Implemented Bidirectional Neural Network and LSTM based deep learning model to detect fake news from a given news corpus.
